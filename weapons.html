  <h1>Top 5 Weapons</h1>
  <p>In mech arena, there are an asortment of weapons you can equip onto your mech to bring them to the next level. Some auto target and curve to an enemy, others are beam attacks; some weapons fire quickly while others fire slower but more powerfully. <br> Your weapons on your mechs are custom to you. Just to keep in mind for a weapon with more than 8 energy capacity you only get one of it, instead of two. I will be taking this into consideration when ranking weapons. Let me show you the best weapons. </p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible"><img src="carbine.jpeg" alt="carbine" class="center"class="center"><strong>1. Carbine 8, 10, 12</strong></button>
<div class="content">
  <p> Carbine 12 is the epitome of an all range weapons, from the range of a sniper but also able to shoot at close range, wity devastating consequences. Carbine shoots in burst fire, so it will quickly shoot around 3 bullets and then will wait a bit and shoot some more. This means there are periods of vulenrability through the fire, where you can take cover or attack. The carbine 12 is phonemonal. The 8 is the best though as you get 2 gurns, more bang for your buck and as you can lternate their fire this can be deadly, as you can cover ones reload with another's burst. The major downside though is it's cost, it costs 8,725 a-coins, the gaurdian costs 975 a-coins in comparision.</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible"><img src="missile.jpeg" alt="missile rack" class="center"class="center"><strong>2. Missile Rack 6, 8</strong></button>
<div class="content">
  <p> Judging from the missile rack 6, you might feel underwhelmed. On paper the missile rack has many weaknesess as you fire as your rockets 2 at a time in one quick salvo, and the. have to relaod for 8 seconds. But the Damage from the salvo is so great you don't even need to worry. You can also get 2 for the missile rack 8 to just decimate the opposition while not leaving yourself open, firing one at a time. It is so veratile and will owrk on any mech. One of the est builds in the game is a missile rack 8 on a Zephyr.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible"><img src="railgun.jpeg" alt="railgun" class="center"class="center"><strong>3. Railgun 16</strong></button>
<div class="content">
  <p> The king of snipers, able to take down any mech even brickhouses, each shot doing 14,000 damage per SHOT at base level. For context the missile rack does 13,000 damage at base level for its entire magazine. And if that is not broken enough it recharges ammo while shooting, meaning you never 
really have to reaload, a downside of most snipers. The only smlal downside is that your targeting does not snap to enemies, but his i really usfeul when you want to shoot other things or a differnt mech to the one you would target
</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible"><img src="arc.jpeg" alt="arc torrent" class="center"class="center"><strong>4. Arc Torrent 8,10</strong></button>
<div class="content">
  <p> The Arc Torrent, the king of the close range. It will decimate at close ranges, perfect for a killshot who works well at that range. It is a beam attack which reloads and may seem slow in damage, but it is amazing. The electricity texture is so cool. <br> It is a staple for any scout trying to kill enemies quickly.
</p>
</div>  

<button type="button" class="collapsible"><img src="javelin.jpeg" alt="javelin rack" class="center"class="center"><strong>5. Javelin Rack 4,6</strong></button>
<div class="content">
  <p> Two words, homing missiles. That is right, the javelin rack homes in on it targets and can go over under or around obstacles to reach its target. While its dps is not the highest is more than capable of finishing off a cheeky scout of picking off weak mechs.
