        <h2>Use Killshot for Control Points</h2>
        <p>When playing a control pointclash match, head for the glowing rings (above), and try to capture them. With killshot you can use your dash ability to quickly get 3 control points at the start of the game to give your team a boost. <br> Since it counts every econd you have a control to your points, the fatsre you are the better. Dash at the very start to get there fast. Be careful though as an unwary killshot can get decimated on the central control point. You will be prime target for javelin racks so dash away if you get targeted. Be fast and escpse quickly to play best with killshot in Control Point Clash. </p>

        <h2>Use the map to your advantage</h2>
        <p>Even though you can't look at a map before your match, in those seonds of choosing your mech take into consideration the map. <br> The one above would be great for a javelin rack that can curve around obstacles and a panther's ability could split the field and turn the tide of battle. On a long corridor you can easily get picked off if you are a slow mech. You can flank but risk being in the open or head down the middle but face the brunt of the other team. Choose wher you go to maximise your mech. These descions are crucial. </p>

        <h2>Be wary of enemies</h2>
        <p>Especially when you are a scout you cannot take that much damage. Before you rush in survey the situtation. Try to kill mechs seperated from the group or ones with low health. You will probbaly not last a long firefight Also try to go round enemies as you gain more damage from behind, this can even let you take down tanks. Careful play and good strategy is key to victory and play. </p>
