  <h1>Top 5 Mechs</h1>
  <p>This is a list of, in my opinion the best mechs in the game, there are those that have the coolest abilities or are really good. An honorable mention is Arachnos, a mech that deploys a spider turret.There are so many more mechs to be found in the game but this is just a sample. I hope you enjoy!</p>
  
  <button type="button" class="collapsible"><img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/mech-arena-robot-showdown/images/6/65/Killshot.jpeg" alt="killshot"class="center"><br><strong>1. Killshot</strong></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>This mech is hands down the bast in the game. Firstly it is a scout, meaning it is very fast, sometimes twice as fast as some tanks! A downside of a scout is that they are weak, this is not the case for Killshot, with a meelee dash ability able to decimate mechs. Another strength of the melee dash is that it only has a 6 second cooldown compared to 18 second ability cooldown compared to other mechs.<br>I love to play killshot, getting up close to the enemy or chasing lone mechs. Playing killshot also lets me take on any mech incuding tanks which should seem out of reach<br>Killshot also has decent energy capacity, 24.The only downside is that is does not have that much health, but that is not that major as you can just dash away from the threat</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible"><img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/mech-arena-robot-showdown/images/8/80/Panther.jpeg" alt="panther" class="center"class="center"><strong>2. Panther</strong></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>This mech is an amazing sniper. It's abilit lays downa sasis barrier where any mech that touches it get slowed right down. Also you can shoot through the barrier while you enemies can't. <br>Panther also has the highest energy capacity in the game, 32, so is able to wield the strongest weapons. This also makes it one of the most versatile, in terms of weapons, mechs in the game. It also has decent speed, but sadly not that much health. With panther the map is your oyster. You can pick off enemy mechs, or engage in standoffs with enemy snipers. You could also try and score moving kills to secure that extra flank damage </p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible"><img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/mech-arena-robot-showdown/images/7/70/BRICKHOUSE.JPEG" alt="brickhouse" class="center"class="center"><strong>3. Brickhouse</strong></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Brickhouse is THE tank, with 32 energy capcity, the highest health and an ability that buffs its weapons, this tank is a forfce to be reckoned with. Firstly, its energy capcity, Brickhouse's energy capacity means it can equip the tsrongest wepaons in the game, capable of tearing down any mech. Then, we get its health, this means that to defeat a brickhouse you need at least another brickhouse, if not multiple mechs. If the its weapons were not powerful enough without a buff, there are devasting with one. Brickhouse's ability buffs athe damage of its allies and itself's weapons with it ability, leadidn to exorbitant damage numbers.</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible"><img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/mech-arena-robot-showdown/images/2/2b/ZEPHYR.JPEG" alt="zephyr" class="center"class="center"><strong>4. Zephyr</strong></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Zephyr is solid. It stops the enemy moving, shooting or doing anything. With its fast speed it can ambush mechs and take goups of them out. One of the best builds in the game is zephyr with missile racks, which can decimate mechs, especially if they are crowded up. Zephyr also has a good 24 energy capacity. Sadly, this also makes it reliant on its ability and vulnerable with it on cooldown.</p>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible"><img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/mech-arena-robot-showdown/images/f/fa/Guardian.jpg" alt="gaurdian" class="center"class="center"><strong>5. Guardian</strong></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Gaurdian has a decent amount of health, which is unusual for an attcaker, nearly enough to rival a tank's. It has high energy capacity meaning you can equip really powerful weapons on it. Guardian is a slow tanky mech which can system crash enemy mechs, which makes them  relaod both their weapons and ability, this ability can also cancel out stasis barriers, shields,and any mech's abilty and forcing them to reload. This ability works like a wave affctinbg any mech in the vicnity of the wave. This means Guardian prefers short ranged weapons to use the most of it's ability. It's ability can be used to diable and kill mechs or run away if there are too many. Persoanlly i put missile rack on it for quick damge when using the ability.</p>
